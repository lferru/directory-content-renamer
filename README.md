# directory-content-renamer
This python script is primarily used to rename directory contents with seemingly random names with a more ordered pattern.
Example: files 494.jpg, 494 (1).jpg, 000.jpg in /folder/ would be renamed a.jpg, b.jpg, and c.jpg, with names assigned 
according to date created. More customized options are planned for the future.
